To Do -
* Dark theme, preliminary styling is there <br>
✓ Inside posts need styling, ex: https://puu.sh/JoU3y/a6d8539865.png spacing margins between Suggested Topics too large <br>
✓ Rounded consistency, some buttons are still sharp that go under different tag names like "summary" <br>
✓ Banner search (not Header search) styling in FF, has black corners <br>
✓ Style drop-downs <br>
✓ Style hover effects & w/ animations <br>
* Toggle class of nav bar based on x.scrollTop() = 0, true | false <br>
* Check longer Recent Searches drop-down for search header isn't overlapped by z-indexing <br>
