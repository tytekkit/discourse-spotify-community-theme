* Inside posts need styling
* Rounded consistency, some buttons are still sharp that go under different tag names like "summary"
* Banner search (not Header search) styling in FF, has black corners
* Style drop-downs
* Style hover effects & w/ animations
* Toggle class of nav bar based on x.scrollTop() = 0, true | false
* Check longer Recent Searches drop-down for search header isn't overlapped by z-indexing
